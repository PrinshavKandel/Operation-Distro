# Operation-Distro
Project Distro is a Qt based system designed to provide class statistics and explore possible alternate grading systems used in universities globally, through the means of the Normal distribution. This project seeks to implement the Probability Distribution Function (PDF) to generate a bell curve as a means to visualize data. The Bell Curve will help us visualize skewness, measures of central tendency and measures of Data Spread.
This system is designed to assist university faculty in analyzing student performance data and a possible alternate grading approach that is dynamic and better suited for general courses that are less critical to certain majors.
The program takes in a data set as an input, then calculates the Standard deviation (Ïƒ) and the mean to then use the Gaussian Function to generate a curve. The GUI work of this program will be done using a cross-platform framework for C++ called the Qt creator.
This aims to serve as an easy to use data visualization tool which displays the normal distribution of the class grades be it on a test or an exam, which can be used for data analytics and alternatively a grading system that is aimed towards general courses to reduce the burden that puts on students
